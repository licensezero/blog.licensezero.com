title: Cult of the Free
subtitle: protecting the value of work

I've been mulling Peter-Paul Koch's ["I Love MDN, or the cult of the free in action"](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2020/08/i_love_mdn_or_t.html), published earlier today.  So have many others.  If you haven't yet read the piece yourself, you should go ahead and do so.  It's well worth taking in on its own terms, for content and presentation.  Don't let me run it yet.

I mention the post here since many folks who read this blog will find it interesting.  But also to lift out a theme that Peter-Paul didn't choose to develop so well as others: undermining the value of good work.

In business, we have the old cliche: "honest pay for honest work".  On its face, this just means that people want good money.  But as a principle, it goes both ways.  Professionals I came up working for _insisted_ on paying me, and everyone else under them, as much as they insisted on being paid their own worth.

Partly this was about reputation, and not about their work.  Nobody wants clients or workers whispering "slave driver" behind their back, especially about behavior toward relatively junior players just breaking into the field.  And many feel a debt of gratitude and an obligation to pay forward the help they had making their starts.  They enjoy opportunities to play the roles of those they'd looked up to.

But a more directly self-interested line runs through these noble concerns.  If those working for you can be had for nothing or next to it, why are you so expensive?  Could the client cut you out as middleman?

Analogies abound.  Would you pay $100 for a bottle of wine if you knew the grapes were bought on sale, or fell off the back of a truck?  Would you pay $100 for a bottle of wine with a $6 bottle on the shelf next to it?  Would you pay a million dollars for a famous artist's painting  ... that their assistants painted in London while they vacationed in France?

In art, design, architecture, and adjacent fields, we see these tensions in the long-running debate on "spec work".  Spec work, broadly speaking, means work done for free in hopes of enticing paying customers.

A client may put out a contest for the design of a new building.  If they don't invite particular contestants, and agree to fund the development of their proposals, that work is "spec work".  If you spend ten hours on your design, but only come in second, you eat your costs.  Likewise the hours spent painting art pieces for a portfolio.  Or the labor in a novel you wrote to pitch to agents, rather than on contract with a publisher.

When you speculate with your time and "win", you're likely to be quite happy with your play.  Like the guy who buys the raffle ticket at the fair and actually wins, your one-off financial picture is rosy.  You've spent very little make a great deal.

Ideally, others in the running made rational choices about whether to bid, and how much to bet, so they're not out more than what they stood to gain time their own likelihood of victory.  But even so, the whole process leaves an overall impression, and not just on individual accounts.  The idea of free spec work has been normalized.  The client, and others like it, will expect to receive bids without spending a dime in the future.  And insofar as the work done for free looks like work done for pay, psychologically, the whole arrangement casts a shadow on the value of the field.

If everyone were rational, they'd get the whole picture from all points of view, and take no general lesson away about the services on hire.

In software, open source is often "spec work" of a kind.

One reading of open source finance sees developer compensation in reputation, rather than cash.  Accumulate enough reputation, you might be able to trade it in for a lucrative job or well paid contractor gigs.  Those opportunities may or may not have anything to do with open source or your open source work.  And once you've earned your opportunity, there may or may not be enough benefit left in reputation to keep you in open source.

Similarly for companies.  Give an enticing morsel of code away for free.  Then leverage that very public work as a badge of corporate competence to land a paying development deal.  Or use it to drive demand for paid, additional features.

In the big picture, the practice of giving open source software for free arguably demeans the value of software.  It's not that software becomes less useful.  It's that people become accustomed to getting a great deal from it without giving anything in return.  This mismatch can also be weaponized.  We see it in claims of "dumping", when companies provide goods or services at cost or even at a loss, conditioning consumers to low or not prices, long enough to drive their competitors out of the market.  At which point they enjoy a monopoly.

We also see the opposite error, in the form of cartels or other price-fixing arrangements.  In these situations, sellers make what should be cheaper available only at higher prices.
